We're making available the following software components for anyone's use under MIT license terms:

* **[yente](/docs/yente/)** - an entity matching API that can be used to run queries against the data produced by OpenSanctions. It is used to run [self-hosted screening applications](/docs/self-hosted/).
* **[zavod](https://zavod.opensanctions.org)** - the toolkit used to run the OpenSanctions data pipeline, which manages how we ingest, normalise, and publish data repeatably from many varied sources.
* **[nomenklatura](https://github.com/opensanctions/nomenklatura)** - the data integration system used to store entity data with full lineage and to integrate entity profiles across multiple sources. 
* We also make available the **code for all of our data crawlers** in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/opensanctions/opensanctions). Please note our FAQ item on [replicating the OpenSanctions data](/docs/bulk/faq/#replication) from source.
