summary:
    Below you'll find instructions on how to run the OpenSanctions software and how to add additional crawlers to the system.

Before we dive into using the software, however, let's explore some of the concepts underlying the system.

## Datasets, sources and collections

OpenSanctions collects data from a variety of sanctions lists and other data providers and converts it into a common, simple-to-use data model. These data are grouped into **datasets**. Some datasets are **sources** and refer to a data origin (e.g. ``eu_fsf``, the EU sanctions list. Other datasets combine data from multiple sources into a **collection** (e.g. ``sanctions``, which collects all sanctions entities from multiple sources).

Both **source** and **collection datasets** have a metadata definition, stored as a YAML file in ``opensanctions/metadata``. **Sources** also include crawler code to parse and import the material. This code is usually located in ``opensanctions/crawlers``.

## Entities and targets

The main objective of OpenSanctions is to combine data from multiple sources into a common data model. To this end, the system uses [FollowTheMoney](/docs/entities/) (FtM), a data modelling and validation library which defines a set of [entity schemata](/reference/#schema), such as [Person](/reference/#schema.Person), [Company](/reference/#schema.Company), 
[Address](/reference/#schema.Address) or [Sanction](/reference/#schema.Sanction). FtM-based entities are stored in a local database and then exported to a variety of file formats.

A peculiarity of the data in OpenSanctions is that sources may mention entities that are merely adjacent to a sanctions target, but not themselves sanctioned. To distinguish the sanctioned entities, they are flagged as **targets** in the database. For most end users that wish to download and use a simple CSV file, chances are that they will want sanctions targets, without the secondary entities in the dataset.

## Using the command-line tool

Once you've successfully [installed](https://zavod.opensanctions.org/install/) the OpenSanctions data pipeline `zavod`, you can use the built-in command-line tool to run parts of the system:

**Note**: The OpenSanctions data pipeline is undergoing restructuring. After installing `zavod`, also install the tooling as documented here by running `pip install -e legacy`. These instructions will be updated when all the functionality below has been moved to `zavod`.

```bash
# Before everything else, flush away cached source data. If you don't 
# do this, you'll essentially work in developer mode where a local
# cached copy of the source data is used instead of fetching fresh
# files:
$ opensanctions clear-workdir

# Crawl and export the US consolidated list:
$ opensanctions crawl us_ofac_cons
$ opensanctions export us_ofac_cons

# This works for both sources and collections. Running a collection will
# crawl all related sources and then export the collection data:
$ opensanctions crawl sanctions
$ opensanctions export sanctions

# Crawling without a specified dataset name will default to using the
# `all` collection which contains all sources:
$ opensanctions crawl
$ opensanctions crawl all

# If you're developing the crawler, you can skip generating the exports and
# only run the crawl stage:
$ opensanctions crawl us_ofac_cons

# Inversely, you can also export a dataset without re-crawling the sources:
$ opensanctions export us_ofac_cons

# During development you might also want to force delete all data linked
# to a source:
$ opensanctions clear us_ofac_cons
```

The available dataset names are determined from the set of metadata YAML files found in ``OPENSANCTIONS_METADATA_PATH`` [configuration](https://zavod.opensanctions.org/install/#configuration).
