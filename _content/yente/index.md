The yente API is built to provide access to [OpenSanctions data](/datasets/), it can also be used to [search and match other data](/docs/yente/datasets/), such as [company registries](/kyb/) or [custom watchlists](/docs/yente/datasets/).

While `yente` is the open source core code base for the [OpenSanctions API](https://api.opensanctions.org), it can also be run [on-premises as a KYC appliance](/docs/self-hosted/) so that no customer data leaves the deployment context. The software is distributed as a Docker image with a pre-defined `docker-compose.yml` configuration that also provisions the requisite ElasticSearch index.

## Using the software

**Note:** this documentation is only relevant to users who plan to [self-host](/docs/self-hosted/) the API. [Click here](/api/) if you'd prefer to use our hosted API service.
