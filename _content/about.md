title: About this project
section: about
summary:
    OpenSanctions is an international database of persons and companies of political, criminal, or economic interest. 
---

The project combines the sanctions lists, databases of politically exposed persons, and other information about persons in the public interest into a single, easy-to-use dataset. This makes it easy to:

* **Cross-check databases** for conflicts of interests and signs of illicit activity.
* **Screen potential customers** and partners in international dealings.
* **Track political conflicts** and compare national sanctions policies.
* Integrate the sanctions and persons of interest graph into existing data products.

### What makes OpenSanctions different?

* **Comprehensive coverage**: we bring together data from [60+ data sources](/datasets/) and from around the world into a single dataset that combines sanctions, PEPs and crime-related entities.
* **Focus on data quality**: the dataset is carefully cleaned, including a human-in-the-loop process for [entity de-duplication across lists](/articles/2021-11-11-deduplication/), and thousands of hand-crafted *data patches* that structure identifying information like birth dates, countries, addresses or tax identifiers in a consistent way.
* **Bulk data for everybody**: we make our raw data easy to access, enabling use cases that require access to the full archive (instead of an entity-by-entity API), and even empowering our customers to [self-host our API server](/docs/self-hosted/) inside their own infrastructure.
* **Auditable and open source**: anyone can verify how OpenSanctions works by browsing the [source code](https://github.com/opensanctions), highlight issues, suggest changes, and propose improvements.

### The rationale

Collecting persons of interest data is a labour intensive process, including data cleaning and quality assurance. This creates unnecessary and duplicative work for all users of persons-of-interest data, whether they are fintech/regtech technologists, investigative journalists, academics or others.

We believe that the solution to this is to establish a **data commons**, an open resource that provides high-quality, up-to-date data, is open to feedback and set up to [provide a long-term solution](/licensing/) for data sourcing.

### Team

The development of OpenSanctions is coordinated by [Friedrich Lindenberg](https://pudo.org).
From 2017 to 2019, maintenance of the crawlers was assumed by [Tarashish Mishra](https://sunu.in/) at the [Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project](https://occrp.org). You can
see a list of those who have contributed crawlers [on Github](https://github.com/opensanctions/opensanctions/graphs/contributors).

We'd also like to thank [Marc da Costa](https://marcdacosta.com/), [Paul May](https://twitter.com/mrpaulmay) and [Tony Bowden](https://twitter.com/tmtm) for their tireless advice on the
project.

### Funding 

From September 2021 to Feburary 2022, the project received financial support from the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und Forschung, BMBF) under the grant identifier ``01IS21S48``. The full responsibility for the content of this publication remains with its
