summary: |
    We founded OpenSanctions as an engineering-centric business that creates high-quality data for risk management and sanctions compliance. Our goal is to provide compelling KYC/AML information at a competitive price.
---

To make this possible, we rely on the cooperation of our prospective business partners. Our prices are structured to enable the development and maintenance of the products we offer; our prices are not structured for us to retain a sales-focused legal team.

With that in mind, here are our asks:

* Our [service agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uLEXJOH-27WENEiDAUlcfbAClkT3Ul08Y6kR1h6V4WE/edit) has been reviewed and accepted by Fortune 500 companies. If you can sign it as-is, please do so. Please don’t make it a point of pride to alter the proposed terms.
* If you need to change the agreement, we’ll consider our relationship an OEM use of the data. Internal-use terms are fully standardised.
* All legal negotiations have to be conducted in writing so that we can consult outside counsel.
* Don’t change the jurisdiction. We’re based in Germany, a jurisdiction that puts significant regulatory and liability-related responsibilities on us. You’re in great hands.

If the suggestion of a limited redlining process seems unrealistic to you, this may be an indication that you need to do business with the LexisNexis Industrial Complex.
