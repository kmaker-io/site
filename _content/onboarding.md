### Get to know the data

The data extracts are published in [multiple formats](/docs/bulk/) and in different
slices:

* [Full OpenSanctions data](/datasets/default/) bulk downloads with all data sources.
* [Sanctions-only data](/datasets/sanctions/) bulk downloads with data from 30+ sanctions lists.
* [PEPs data](/pep/) bulk downloads with 160,000+ politically exposed persons.

As you start processing the data, we recommend you read the introduction to [entity data](/docs/entities/) and have a look at the [data dictionary](/reference/).

### Get to know us

OpenSanctions is meant to be a conversation. Whether it is about using the existing data formats, proposing a new data source or reporting a mistake in the data - we are keen to know your thoughts and concerns.

* Join the **[OpenSanctions Slack](https://bit.ly/osa-slack)** and post any questions and comments to the `#support` channel.
