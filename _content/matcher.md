summary: |
    The OpenSanctions API supports matching of entities using a simple query-by-example
    mechanism. For transparency, you can find details regarding the used algorithms, and
    in particular the weighting of features used to compute scores, here.

The API offers a selection of scoring algorithms described below. Both the [training data](/docs/pairs/) and [the code](https://github.com/opensanctions/nomenklatura/tree/master/nomenklatura/matching) are fully public, inviting public scrutiny and proposals for improvement.
